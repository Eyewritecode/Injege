Author: Niyikiza Aimable

Initial release Date: April 19, 2014

Licence: IDC(I don't Care)--Use it in anyway you want, all at your own risk.

<b> Objectives

This is the official implementation --indeed the first step-- of the <b>Injege -- "Upload Kinyarwanda"</b> initiative. As a long term objective, I want to collect a large corpora of Kinyarwanda text that can be used by researchers and developers to make implementation of modern NLP algorithms on the Kinyarwanda language. With the modern success of Machine Learning applications, it would be saddening for Kinyarwanda to be left behind. 

There are different types of applications that can benefit from the success of this project, both for corporate usage or public interest. Examples of such applications include Kinyarwanda spam filters, Kinyarwanda news aggregators, Kinyarwanda sentiment analysis, machine translation,spelling correction, ...


<b>Development philosophy of Injege

I made this an open source projects in hopes to get contributions from different talents from Rwandans or friends of Rwanda who are interested in helping our mother tongue enter the digital world. As I'm aware, there is none else --corporate or public -- working on such a project, but even if there were one, I believe nothing can beat the open source community on such a project.

The project is still in its infancy but I'm hoping for having time or people who can help scale it.
